It is worth for learning in many times.

In folder, I have upload some pictures about particles, which are created by myself based on NeHe's code.
I have learn much from NeHe's code, and I will update my growing more and more. 

You can run code in VS2008-VS2015, but if you only use VC++6.0, you should delete:#pragma comment(lib, "legacy_stdio_definitions.lib")

And change the glew.h to gl.h, glut.h to glu.h. They are convient to VC++6.0 not VS.

About NeHe's codes run in vs2015, you can look this blog:http://blog.csdn.net/wly95/article/details/51760082 to get a correct enviroment to build code.

Other Tips is,you should add "#pragma comment(lib, "legacy_stdio_definitions.lib")" in front of code.
